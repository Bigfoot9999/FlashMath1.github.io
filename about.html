<h1>About the Creator</h1>
<p>Hello, my Name is Isaac Beverly and I am <18 years old. I created this site to provide entertainment and make a few dollars. I am currently interested in robotics and learning the languages of Python, Java and Perl.  Like many people, I've always wanted a website and am glad that I finally have one. </p>
